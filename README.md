# CryptoClustering Richard Soos Data Visualisation 12Jul2023
# Module19Challenge Unsupervised Learning to see if cryptocurrencies are effected by # 24hr or 7 day price changes
# In this assignment, written in Python, cryptocoin data was loaded to a pandas 
# dataframe and we indexed the dataframe by the cypto coin name.
# The data was scaled we established the most efficient k value, forming clusters.
# We also used the pca method, finding the most efficient k value.
# We compared the grouping, where each method incidentally used the same k method.
# Using just 3 features we considered how this efficiency may effect our groupings.
#
# We were posed one question
# Are Cryptocurrencies affected by 24hr or 7-day price changes.
# We can only look at the groupings on the standardised scatter plot 
# of price change % 7 days against price change percvent 24hr. Location (0,0) point
# on the grpah I sdee an even clustering of data across y = 0, and also across x = 0. 
# I do not believe I can tell which cycle the data follows.
